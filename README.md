# Depreciation-Schedule-Maker

A simple program that takes users inputs on an asset's information and creates a csv file showing a payment schedule

Upon the program initialization, a very straightforward GUI will display, prompting the user to input an asset description, its useful life and its cost.

Upon making valid entries and pressing the calculate button at the bottom of the window, the program will create a csv file and write an amortization scheudule, which will immediately open. The user can find this file saved in the same directory as the folder.
